    <h2>Jack Loo</h2>
    <p>I'm Jack Loo and I'm from Panama, The Republic of Panama. I love to cook and spent time with my family. 
        I like to travel and learn new things. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        since I was a child, I'm a returned missionary, and a nature lover.</p>
      <p>One of my goals is to be a Data Scientist, however, I would like to become first a Software Developer. 
        It amazes me the way we can manipulate data to create new processes to solve needs, 
        store valuable information, or preserve a particular moment.</p>
      <p>I know that my Heavenly Father will help me during this journey and I know this career will change 
        my life.
