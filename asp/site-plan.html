      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We live in a digital world, so a website is a necessity for a company, no matter how big or small they are. All Steel Pipe and Fence is a company dedicated to the sale of portable sheds, pipe fence fabrication, and welding services. We are convinced that having a website would increase our market. Our website would be available 24 hours a day and users will be able to access it from various mobile devices. As a company, we always want to innovate. We are more than committed to offering quality products and we want to take advantage of this effective resource to offer new services. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our website focuses on people who do farming. As a company, we have focused 100% on social media, despite the fact that this has helped us grow, we want to look for people within our market who need more detailed information about our company and the services we are offering. We want to appeal to those who need secure websites to do online transactions and talk to customer service.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>Site purpose</p>
      <p>All Steel Pipe and Fence is a company focused on providing quality services and products to people who practice farming. We know that this field is difficult to see the product or quote in person since it is practiced in certain regions throughout the country. In order to improve our company-client relationship, we have launched our website which will make it easier to quote services or see the products we are offering. </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>Reason to visit our site</p>
      <p>As a company, we are committed to providing quality products and services. We are always trying to innovate in the market in order to bring durable products. More than charging for a service, we want to educate our customers and provide them with products that they really need. We recognize the importance of a website and the impact it has on customers, however, if it is not attractive enough, we know that the impact will be negative. That is why we want to make sure that the content of our web page will not take a long time to load on the page since otherwise our clients will lose their initial interest and will be able to go to our competition. We want to control the number of ads being displayed as this could be intrusive and disrupt our users’ experience. Having a lot of ads will slow down our website aggravating the above problem. We also want to make sure of Pop-ups as they can be quite annoying especially when they take up the whole page. We want to make sure that our users’ experience on our website is amazing, so we want to make sure that multimedia elements will not be played automatically as they will feel that we are imposing something on them that they did not request and this could scare them away, especially if they do not find the source where it is playing. We will work to have a website with a good graphic design that is attractive at first sight to our clients and thus prevent them from going to the competition. Likewise, we will be aware that there is no strange redirection when clicking on any of our links, whether on social media, search engines, or other websites. Last but not least one of our most important focuses is to have content that is relevant. In this way, we are making sure to extend our philosophy as a company and to make the sale of our products and services. </p>
      <p>Information</p>
      <p> The first impression of a web page is what really matters. Before our website can complete any action requested by our customers, we must have complete information on certain aspects. We must have a simple URL so that our clients can remember it, a clear and simple description of what our business offers, contact information that includes not only our telephone numbers, but address; photos, and details of our staff, and a mobile responsive design.

      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Expectations </p>
      <p>One thing we particularly notice from our customers who contact us through social media is the specifications of our products. We want to work on our website so that it can answer questions about the specifications of the pipes fence, provide details of rate and shipping, and general details of our portable sheds. Usually, customers want to check previous work before they purchase a product or service. Having a website will help us publicize our previous work and we will also have a section where customers can fill out a form to do more personalized work. </p> 
      <p> Activities</p>
      <p>There are (3) three activities that we are projecting our clients to do. (1) Based on previous conversations, our customers feel more secure making digital payments than cash payments, so our website will have the option to pay online. (2) There will be an image gallery with final works and customer reviews. (3) We will have a chat section so that our customers can communicate with us in real time. </p>
