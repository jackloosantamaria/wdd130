    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> Outdoor activities have been proven to help increase our energy level, reduce
        our stress and help improve our mental health. Studies have proven that rafting 
        is one of the best outdoor activies for the body. Not only does it help our balance 
        but it help us develop confidence and a sense of accomplishment. We need the website 
        to publicize the company, share experiences, and let the people know the benefits of 
        this sport in order to call potential customers and increase company's revenue. 
        When we explain our purpose and when we are honest with our customers it will 
        benefit us as a company as we will have the opportunity to provide more services.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The website is more focused on people who like to spend time outdoors and people who 
        enjoy hiking or doing water activities. Since rafting is an activity that is done with 
        more than 8 years old, we will focus on young adults. Our clients are people looking to 
        improve their physical and mental health. Usually, people who do not practice this sport 
        do not have the appropiate equipment because of how expensive it is, however we as a 
        company will provide this equipment and trained personnel at no additional cost. Our 
        customers can access to our website through laptop, desktop, and mobile devices.
